## About

Existing solutions didn't work for me (https://github.com/bengsfort/WakaTime-Unity is obsolete and https://github.com/josec89/wakatime-unity requires Python), so I decided to implement my own variant.

## Installation using the Unity Package Manager (Unity 2018.1+)

The [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html) (UPM) is a new method to manage external packages. It keeps package contents separate from your main project files.

1. Run the Unity editor, go to `Assets\View in Package Manager`.
2. Click the `+` icon. (top left of window that opened)
3. Click `Add package from git url`.
4. Type `https://github.com/vladfaust/unity-wakatime.git#package`.

## Installation (all other Unity versions)

If you don't use the Unity Package Manager, you may copy the `Editor` folder from inside `Assets/com.vladfaust.unitywakatime` into your project's `Assets` folder.

## Setup

1. Run the Unity editor, go to `Window/WakaTime`, and insert your API key (grab one from https://wakatime.com/settings/account)
2. Press `Save Preferences`
3. Check if `"Unity"` editor appears at https://wakatime.com/api/v1/users/current/user_agents (may be a bit delayed)
4. Enjoy!

## Usage

The plugin will automatically send heartbeats to WakaTime after following events:

* DidReloadScripts
* EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged
* EditorApplication.contextualPropertyMenu
* EditorApplication.hierarchyWindowChanged
* EditorSceneManager.sceneSaved
* EditorSceneManager.sceneOpened
* EditorSceneManager.sceneClosing
* EditorSceneManager.newSceneCreated

## Development

Use the manual installation method, so the changes you make are immediately reflected in the editor.
But please keep the repository sane, omitting any unnecessary files.
When added a new file, move its `.meta` counterpart generated by Unity into the `/CI/Meta` folder.
